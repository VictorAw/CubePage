# Cube

## Background

Cube is a simple demonstration of WebGL.

There will be an explorable area, with a couple of interactions. The primary showpiece will be a cube floating on a pedastal that the user can drag to rotate. The user will also be able to roam around the room.

## Functionality & MVP

Users will be able to:

- [ ] Walk around the environment and properly collide with walls
- [ ] Click on the cube and drag the mouse to rotate the cube horizontally
- [ ] Have the cube change color based on the mouse drag position
- [ ] Have sound play when clicking on the cube
- [ ] Open an additional room that can be accessed by clicking on a door or switch
- [ ] Hear environmental sound effects
- [ ] Have basic lighting

Sound will be generated by loading audio into the Web Audio API. 

Collisions will be programmed from scratch using 3-dimensional hitboxes. 

Cube color will use cube rotation angle as an input into the color shader, allowing the color to be changed based on how much the cube is rotated. 

Click functionality will be generated through raycasts.

Lighting will be done through shaders.

## Architecture and Technologies

- [ ] WebGL
- [ ] Sylvester
- [ ] glUtils.js
- [ ] Webpack to bundle up scripts

In addition to the tools listed above, there will be a script file for:

- [ ] Collision detection
- [ ] Loading the correct shaders and vertices
- [ ] Physics
- [ ] Handling interaction

## Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Set up Sylvester and an entry javascript file along with an html file. Get the canvas rendering a basic cube.

**Day 2**: Get shaders working and add in vertices for the walls and entryway of the room. Start collision detection.

**Day 3**: Finish collision detection, physics, and controls. Add environmental sound effects using the Web Audio API

**Day 4**: Finishing touches and polish

## Bonus Features

There are many things that I would like to add to the project if time permits:

- [ ] A contact me section in the user interface where a letter pops up that the user can type into and send an email to me with
- [ ] Additional rooms with additional interactions
- [ ] Hidden rooms to discover and explore
