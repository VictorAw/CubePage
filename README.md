# Cube

[Live link to be inserted later]

Cube is an interactive front-end Javascript project demonstrating WebGL through an interactive enviornment.

Use WASD to navigate through the environment and use the mouse to look around.

# Features & Implementation

The program uses WebGL and HTML5 canvas to render 3D objects and uses a custom-built engine to handle input and state updating. Objects and Cameras are stored in arrays within the engine and all objects are rendered through the active camera's perspective.
